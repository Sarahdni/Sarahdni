- 👋 Hi, I'm @Sarahdni
- 👀 I'm interested in building robust ETL pipelines, data workflow orchestration, and data warehouse optimization
- 🌱 I'm currently working with Apache Airflow, Kafka, and modern data stack to create scalable data architectures
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving data pipeline automation, ETL optimization, and real-time data processing
- 📫 How to reach me: sarah.dinari08@gmail.com or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-dinari-3079a31b6/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Just like the data flows through my ETL pipelines, I let the wind carry me while kitesurfing! 🏄‍♀️
